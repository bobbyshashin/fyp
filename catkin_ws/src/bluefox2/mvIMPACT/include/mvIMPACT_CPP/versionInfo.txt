                        - When working with the socket implementation in setups where the first payload packet  (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          processed was the potential smaller one from the end of a block(e.g. in LAG mode
                          where data tends to arrive out of order) blocks sometimes did contain corrupt data
                          with no error being reported to the upper layers.
                        - When opening a U3V device with event support an error message was written to the      (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          log output because of an incorrect initialisation order.

03.09.2015  2.13.4
                        NEW FEATURES:
                        - Firmware version 1.6.475.0 for mvBlueFOX3 and mvBlueCOUGAR-X devices added.           (all shipped packages for GenICam compliant devices)

                            - mvBlueFOX3: AGC value can now reach up to 48dB for IMX sensors.
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-XD124a, XD126, XD129: maximum image height was incorrect
                              after closing and opening the camera.
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-XD104d, X104f, mvBlueFOX3-2024, 2024a:
                              - in very rare cases switching the image format led to corrupt images.
                              - when using LUT the output image no longer has a "solarize" effect.  
                            - pending ACKs are now being sent when writing to 'mvUserData', 'DeviceUserName',
                              'UserSetDefaultSelector' IP-configuration registers etc.
                        - The QuickSetup Window can now be forcefully shown/hidden by using the 'qsw' command-  (wxPropView)
                          line parameter in wxPropView. This feature overrides the default settings for the 
                          current session but it does not overwrite them.

                        UPDATES:
                        - Detection of lost frames due to buffer under-runs improved.                           (mvGigECapture.sys, version 2.1.1.52)

                                                                                                                (mvVirtualDevice-lib)
                        - Calling 'imageRequestReset' from a thread running in parallel to a thread calling     (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          'imageRequestSingle' could result in a deadlock under Windows for U3V devices.
                        - mvDeviceConfigure did not backup and restore settings correctly if a device e.g. had  (mvDeviceConfigure)
                          a valid UserSet2 and UserSet4, but no UsetSet1 and/or UserSet3.
                        - The QuickSetup Window now correctly disables features if they are not available on    (wxPropView)
                          the running platform.

13.08.2015  2.13.3
                        NEW FEATURES:
                        - Firmware version 1.6.461.0 for mvBlueFOX3 and mvBlueCOUGAR-X devices added.           (all shipped packages for GenICam compliant devices)
                          Changed Behaviour:
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-XD124aG/C: Internal pre-gain reduced by 5dB. This will result in
                              slightly darker but less noisier images after a firmware update.
                            - New default: BalanceWhiteAuto = Off.
                            - All sensors now have default white balance values corresponding to a light
                              temperature of 5000K.
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-X/XD: The 'UserFile', selectable in File Access Control, is be
                              preserved during firmware updates.
                            - AcquisitionFrameRate property does not change its value any more, only by user
                              input. New maximum values provided for this property. The maximum frame rate
                              that can be reached with the current settings may be read from the
                              mvResultingFrameRate property.
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-X(D): Device boot time reduced by 500 ms.

                              'SequencerFeatureSelector', 'SequencerTriggerSource' and
                              'SequencerTriggerActivation' added.
                          Bugs Fixed:
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-X104fG/C: Some devices did not start correctly.
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-X(D): With certain SCPS payload size and AOI combinations in
                              chunk mode the device did crash.
                            - mvBlueFOX3: The data written to 'mvUserData' was not stored in non-volatile
                              memory.
                            - mvBlueFOX3: Calling 'FileOperationExecute' with 'FileOperationSelector' set to
                              'Close' twice did result in a crash.
                            - mvBlueFOX3: Corrected device link speed to 5Gbps for USB super speed.
                            - IMX: Sometimes starting/stopping the acquisition took too long.
                            - IMX: Corrupt images when over-triggering and ExposureMode = TriggerWidth is used.
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-XD124a, XD126, XD129: OffsetY was not set when the image height was 
                              set to the sensor maximum, leading to black stripes in the image
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-X/XD: An upload of a 'UserFile' that exceeds the flash section size
                              could crash the camera.
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-X/XD: When a 'DeviceReset' was executed after a firmware update
                              the device could fail to reboot properly in very rare cases. The status LED
                              would show blueish white color then. Power-cycling the device did fix this.

                        UPDATES:
                        - U3V devices that specify the non-HEX version of the serial number in the U3V device   (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          info serial string descriptor could not be initialised.

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - When a faulty U3V device did not answer when reading the max. device response time    (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          the whole driver did lock up.
                        - When a request timeout for a U3V device did elapse the request result was returned    (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          as 'rrRequestAborted' instead of 'rrTimeout' under Linux.
                        - Under Windows the link speed value of LAG groups has not always been reported         (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          correctly as added in version 2.5.17. This could result in incorrect resend
                          behaviour and/or frames being reported as incomplete even though no data was lost
                          on the link.
                          (Bug introduced in 2.6.0)

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - Calling 'EventKill' for events of type 'EVENT_REMOTE_DEVICE' or 'EVENT_NEW_BUFFER'    (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          did not result in 'EventGetData' to return 'GC_ERR_ABORT' but 'GC_ERR_NO_DATA'.
                        - Payload type 'ExtendedChunk' for GEV devices was not handled correctly. The           (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          'image present' bit was ignored, thus the 'BUFFER_INFO_IMAGEPRESENT' query did return
                          0 even if an image was present in the payload.
                        - Unplugging a U3V device with event support under Linux no longer floods the log       (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          output.
                        - The 'TapSort' filter for RGB 24-bit with 2 pixels per cycle did not re-order the      (mvHYPERIONfg-lib)
                          data correctly when 'ImageProcessingOptimization' was set to                          (mvTITANfg-lib)
                          'ipoMinimizeMemoryUsage'.                                                             (mvVirtualDevice-lib)
                        - mvBlueCOUGAR-XD1212aC devices now correctly use the 'cticmmBlueCOUGAR_XDx212C_WPPLS'  (all shipped packages)
                          color correction matrix by default.
                        - U3V events have been reported in a different order than delivered by the device under (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          Windows.

22.06.2015  2.13.1

                        - Firmware version 1.6.414.0 for mvBlueFOX3 and mvBlueCOUGAR-X devices added.           (all shipped packages for GenICam compliant devices)
                          Changed Behaviour:
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-XD126AG/C,mvBlueCOUGAR-XD129G/C: Improved image quality for higher
                              device clock frequencies.
                          New Features:

                              (Bug introduced in 1.6.403.0)
                            - mvBlueFOX3: Switching 'mvDevicePowerMode' from 'mvActive' to 'mvStandby' and then
                              back to 'mvActive' did result in the chunk mode no longer working.
                              (Bug introduced in 1.6.403.0)
                            - mvBlueFOX3-2024aC/G: Only 32 instead of 41 Hz could be reached with

                        - New sample added to all packages: 'ContinuousCaptureGenICam_C'.                       (all shipped packages)

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - Calling 'attachUserBuffer' for a request that had a user buffer with a different      (all shipped packages)
                          size attached to it before could fail.
                        - The VB.NET example 'ContinuousCapture.VB.exe' also uses the 'getDeviceFromUserInput'  (all shipped MSI-based packages)
                          function from 'mv.impact.acquire.example.helper.dll' now thus also automatically
                          selects the 'dilGenICam' interface layout if available.
                        - mvBlueFOX3 cameras with event support on Linux systems may cause a segmentation fault (mvGenTLConsumer-lib)
                          when closing the device.
                         (Bug introduced in version 2.12.4)

11.06.2015  2.13.0
                        UPDATES:
                        - All example applications will now use the interface layout 'dilGenICam' and the       (all shipped packages)
                          acquisition start/stop mode 'assbUser' if supported by the selected device.

                        NEW FEATURES:
                        - Added support for pixel format YUV411_UYYVYY_Packed.                                  (all shipped packages)

                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-XD: Gain for DigitalTaps was ten times higher than the value in the
                              corresponding register.

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - mvBlueFOX-MLC202b devices operated in triggered mode did result in incorrectly        (mvBlueFOX-lib)
                          exposed images for certain exposure times.
                        - If 2 processes during start-up where configured for log-output into a file both       (all shipped packages)
                          processes could lock up. This problem affects ALL mvIMPACT Acquire packages, thus
                          when running more than one driver package on a system ALL package should be updated!
                          (Bug introduced in version 1.12.70)
                        - Capturing images with more than 64 MByte memory consumption could lead to problems.   (low level mvHYPERION driver, Windows)
                          (Bug introduced in version 2.11.4)

13.05.2015  2.12.4

                        - Firmware version 1.6.393.0 for mvBlueFOX3 and mvBlueCOUGAR-X devices added.           (all shipped packages for GenICam compliant devices)
                          Changed Behaviour:
                            - mvBlueFOX3: Changed the status in case of a buffer too small from
                              'U3V_STATUS_DATA_DISCARDED' to 'U3V_STATUS_DATA_OVERRUN' as required by the
                              U3V specification version 1.0.1.
                          New Features:
                            - 'ChunkSequencerSetActive' for all devices supporting the sequencer control
                              category.
                            - Support for new product added: mvBlueFOX3-2024aG/C.
                          Bugs Fixed:
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-X125: FFC Calibration bug fixed.
                            - Missing invalidation of 'LineStatus' and 'LineStatusAll' when writing to
                              'LineInverter' or 'LineMode'

                        NEW FEATURES:
                        - 'IAMCameraControl' feature 'CameraControl_Exposure' as well as the 'AMVideoProcAmp'   (DirectShow_acquire.ax)
                          features 'VideoProcAmp_Brightness' and 'VideoProcAmp_Gain' correctly handle the
                          'Auto' option as well as the runtime availability of these features.

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - Calling 'IAMCameraControl::Get' with 'CameraControl_Exposure' did return a value      (DirectShow_acquire.ax)
                          that was differed from the actual value by 1.
                        - Calling 'IAMCameraControl::GetRange' with 'CameraControl_Exposure' did return an      (DirectShow_acquire.ax)
                          invalid value for 'pSteppingDelta'.
                        - Devices specifying a category with a deprecated name as well as a category with the   (mvGenTLConsumer-lib)
                          name the deprecated one has been replaced within their GenICam file could not be
                          initialized.

08.05.2015  2.12.3
                        UPDATES:
                        - Detection of lost frames due to buffer under-runs improved.                           (mvGigECapture.sys, version 2.1.0.51)
                                                                                                                (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                        - Status bar displays more statistics now.                                              (wxPropView)
                        - The GenICam nodemaps of the 'System Module' and the 'Interface Module' more closely   (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          comply with the GenICam GenTL SFNC 1.0 now.

                        CHANGED BEHAVIOUR:
                        - The mvGenTLProducer is now fully compliant with the GenICam GenTL validation          (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          framework. This however required some changes that might affect applications relying
                          on some MATRIX VISION specific GenTL producer behaviour:
                          - After calling 'GCUnregisterEvent' for a given event or after closing the module
                            associated with an event the event handle will become invalid now.
                          - DevicePort related function calls will now fail after closing the associated
                            device.
                          - Calling 'DSGetBufferID' with an invalid index will now fail.
                          - Calling 'DSStartAcquisition' with 'iNumToAcquire' set to 0 will now fail.
                          - Read from or writing to the device port of a device that has been closed will
                            now fail.
                          - Calling 'DSAnnounceBuffer' while an acquisition is running will now fail.
                        - On Windows 8 and greater less shortcuts will be created in the start menu now as      (all shipped MSI-based packages)
                          since Windows 8 nested folders in the start menus are no longer allowed.

                        NEW FEATURES:
                        - Under Linux an internal thread pool is now used to speed up de-bayer processing time. (all shipped Linux packages)
                          This will increase the number of threads created by the number of processors per
                          initialised device in a process.
                        - New properties published: mvIMPACT::acquire::Request::chunkSequencerSetActive,        (mvIMPACT_acquire.h)
                          mvIMPACT::acquire::GenICam::DataStreamModule::mvResendMode,
                          mvIMPACT::acquire::Statistics::bandwidthConsumed (C++),
                          mv.impact.acquire.Request.chunkSequencerSetActive,                                    (mv.impact.acquire.dll)
                          mv.impact.acquire.GenICam.DataStreamModule.mvResendMode,
                          mv.impact.acquire.bandwidthConsumed (NET)
                        - GenCP 1.1 multi-event support added. If supported by the device this will be enabled  (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          by the GenTL producer now.
                        - U3V event support for Linux added.                                                    (mvGenTLProducer.cti)

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - QuickSetup Window: Pressing 'Cancel'/'Factory Reset' will now correctly revert/set    (wxPropView)
                          all relevant ColorTwist properties respectively.
                        - The original payload type from the underlying transport layer was reported instead of (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          the GenTL payload type for the 'BUFFER_INFO_PAYLOADTYPE' query. This could result in
                          problem when processing chunk data with 3rd party software.
                        - Accessing a data stream buffer through the GenICam node map now works properly.       (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                        - Constantly opening and closing U3V devices with event support did result in failures  (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          during open calls after some time.
                        - Calling mv.impact.acquire.FunctionInterface.imageRequestUnlock directly after         (mv.impact.acquire.dll)
                          increasing the request count for a newly created request index did crash.
                        - When a device did stream image data in chunk mode the paddingX field from the leader  (mvGenTLConsumer-lib)
                          of the transport layer specific data was not used to correctly set the line pitch of
                          the request buffer.
                        - When a device did stream image data in chunk mode the pixel format property from the  (mvGenTLConsumer-lib)
                          leader of the transport layer specific data was not used to correctly set the pixel
                          format of the request buffer. This could cause problems when the pixel format did 
                          change from buffer to buffer (e.g. when using the SequencerControl).
                        - When a device implemented the 'TLParamsLocked' feature as an actual device register   (mvGenTLConsumer-lib)
                          and this register stayed set for whatever reasons when an application did terminate
                          opening the device again did not reset this parameter causing problems when trying
                          to configure the device.
                        - Properties defining a minimum value that did not align with the step width rounding   (mvPropHandling-lib)
                          was not done correctly. So a feature with a valid value range from 3 to 18 with a
                          step width of 5 did not allow to set values of 3, 8, 13 and 18 but only 5, 10 and 15.
                        - Updating chunk data in a request buffer could fail, if the chunk features did include (mvGenTLConsumer-lib)
                          selectors, that are there but are not available at the given moment.
                        - When switching chunk mode off requests no longer display 'old' chunk data when        (mvGenTLConsumer-lib)
                          streaming in image mode.
                        - mvHYPERION-SDI: Sometimes the first images captured were distorted. This could mainly (mvHYPERIONfg-lib)
                          be seen with 3G camera signals.                                                       (low level mvHYPERION driver, Linux and Windows)

26.03.2015  2.12.2
                        UPDATES: 
                        - Firmware version 1.6.360.0 for mvBlueFOX3 and mvBlueCOUGAR-X devices added.           (all shipped packages for GenICam compliant devices)
                          Changed Behaviour:
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-X(D)104(b)G/C, mvBlueCOUGAR-XD204(b)G/C: Exact frame rate.
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-X, mvBlueFOX3 with EV76Cxxx sensors: Correct YOffset in line-scan
                              mode. There was an offset of 5 lines compared to areas scan.
                          New Features:
                            - mvBlueFOX3: Chunk support added.
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-X(D): Action command support added.

                          12MiB and increasing it, if possible, up to 32MiB in 4MiB increments.
                        - Improved GenTL validation framework compliance. This did change the behaviour of
                          some of the functions exported by the mvGenTLProducer-lib:
                          - All 'GetInfo' function can no longer be called with an invalid 'INFO_DATATYPE'
                            pointer.
                          - Calling 'IFClose' causes all devices associated with this interface to be closed
                            as well.
                          - The deprecated 'StreamAcquisitionModeSelector' feature of the data stream module
                            has been replaced by the official 'StreamBufferHandlingMode'.

                            'INFO_DATATYPE_UINT32' to 'INFO_DATATYPE_INT32'.

                        NEW FEATURES:
                        - The property mvIMPACT::acquire::SystemSettings::imageProcessingOptimization (C/C++)   (mvIMPACT_acquire.h)
                          or mv.impact.acquire.SystemSettings.imageProcessingOptimization (.NET) can now be     (mv.impact.acquire.dll)
                          used to influence the behaviour of the internal image processing algorithms.

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - Under Linux when the same interface(same MAC address) was present more than once in   (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          the ifconfig table some internal list have not been updated correctly and therefore
                          devices connected to this interface could not be accessed. This could e.g. happen
                          when an avahi daemon was running on an interface already configured with e.g. dhcp
                          or static ip.
                        - The 'auto assign temp IP' option did only work if both the IP as well as the          (mvIPConfigure)
                          netmask where invalid.
                        - Crashes in the destructor of the classes                                              (mvIMPACT_acquire_GenICam.h)

                          mvIMPACT::acquire::GenICam::IDevFileStream when an attempt to open a file did fail.
                        - 'CaptureToUserMemory_C' did fail when requesting a single frame for devices with      (CaptureToUserMemory.c)
                          AcquisitionStartStopBehaviour' set to 'assbUser'.
                        - Potential crashes in the channel split filter when working with 'ibpfMono12Packed_V1' (all shipped packages)
                          or 'ibpfMono12Packed_V2' formats.

                          (Bug introduced in version 2.11.9)
                        - When unicasting GEV Action commands only the first action command could be sent while (mvGenTLProducer.cti)

                        - The function mv.impact.acquire.helper.RequestProvider.acquisitionStart did fail when  (mv.impact.acquire.dll)
                          called a second time even if mv.impact.acquire.helper.RequestProvider.acquisitionStop
                          has been called before.

                              formats other than Mono8 or BayerRG8.
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-X100wG/C: Frame rate for trigger burst modes corrected.
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-XD104dG/C, mvBlueCOUGAR-X104fG/C: Changing the pixel format
                              could result in corrupt images.

23.10.2014  2.11.2
                        UPDATES:
                        - Firmware version 1.6.230.0 for mvBlueFOX3 and mvBlueCOUGAR-X devices added.           (all shipped packages for GenICam compliant devices)
                          New Features:
                            - mvBlueFOX3-2024G/C: New mvBlueFOX3 hardware added with support for IMX174 sensor.
                          Bugs Fixed:
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-X100wG/C: Corrupt image in HDR-mode.
                            - mvBlueFOX3-1020G/C: Some sensors were showing stripes in saturated areas.

                        CHANGED BEHAVIOUR:

                          set to 'SingleFrame' calling 'acquisitionStop' will also send a stop command to the
                          device now in order to properly terminate outstanding frame requests there.
                        - Loading a setting in 'GenICam' or 'Generic' interface layout will only work if the    (mvGenTLConsumer-lib)
                          setting has been created with the same interface layout AND at least the same
                          product. Thus e.g. loading a setting created with a mvBlueCOUGAR-X122G will only work
                          for other mvBlueCOUGAR-X122G devices.
                        - For U3V devices the driver will access the 'MaxDeviceResponseTime' register first     (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          now.

                        NEW FEATURES:

                          Changed Behaviour:
                          - mvBlueCOUGAR-XD: Link process with only one link now completes faster.
                          Bugs Fixed:
                          - mvBlueCOUGAR-X105G/C: mvShutterMode was not available.

                          - mvBlueCOUGAR-XD126C: Max Height could be set to wrong values if switching the
                            SensorTap property.
                          - Changing ExposureMode to TriggerWidth did not work correctly.
                          - mvBlueFOX3: In some cases e.g. after changing the exposure time BF3 sent 
                            corrupted frames.
                          - FrameStart signal wasn't correct.
                        - Support for third party GenICam devices that change the 'IsImplemented' feature of    (mvGenTLConsumer-lib)
                          their features at runtime improved. These features will now be available, but when    (mvPropHandling-lib)
                          marked as 'not implemented' will have neither read nor write access.
    
                        CHANGED BEHAVIOUR:
                        - When the 'TestMode' property is set to 'ImageDirectory the following changes have     (mvVirtualDevice-lib)
                          been applied:
                          - The 'FrameId' property of a returned request object will contain the index of the
                            image file within the directory
                          - The 'UserData' property of a returned request object will contain the name of the

                            is the last image file in this directory or 'False' otherwise at index 1.

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - Certain internal error codes could end up in the application layer (e.g. GenTL        (mvGenTLConsumer-lib)
                          specific ones) but as these are  not part of the SDK the application could not
                          properly handle them.
                        - For GEV 2.x devices the driver now correctly switches on the '64bitBlockIdEnable' bit (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                        - For GEV the 'Image_ExtendedChunk' format is decoded correctly now.                    (mvGenTLProducer.cti)

                        - Format for storing settings to XML files changed. This change comes with some         (all shipped packages)
                          compatibility issues. XML files created from now on might not be usable with mvIMPACT
                          Acquire versions smaller than 2.11.0! XML files created with older versions will
                          still be readable. See documentation for details.

                          device removal event within the current process did not work correctly. This could
                          e.g. result in a devices 'State' property not going to 'Absent' when calling
                          'DeviceReset' for the very first time.

                          use 55% of their original size, 32-bit packages about 50%.

                          late in the filter driver. This is now in sync. with the socket layer based
                          implementation.

                        NEW FEATURES:
                        - New color correction matrix added: 'cticmmBlueFOX3_x031C_WPPLS' This will be used by  (all shipped packages)

                          now.
                        - Internal conversion filter added. When a device transfers in either of these formats: (all shipped packages)
                          'ibpfMono12Packed_V1', 'ibpfMono12Packed_V2' or 'ibpfBGR101010Packed_V2', and at
                          least one post-processing filter can't deal with this format, the driver will now
                          silently convert this data into a suitable format if possible.
                        - Firmware version 1.5.95.0 for mvBlueCOUGAR-X devices added.                           (all shipped packages for GigE Vision devices)
                          New features:
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-X1010: DeviceClockFrequency 96 Mhz added.
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-X102e: High dynamic range added (mvLinearLogarithmicMode).
                          Bugs fixed:
                            - CCD-sensors: Changing the exposure time was delayed by one frame when using long
                              exposure times.
                            - mvBlueCOUGAR-XD-124/126/129: Visible SUB-pulse in overlapped trigger mode.

                              already up.
                          Changed behaviour:

                          in no commands being sent at all.
                        - Some newly introduced header files where missing in the Linux packages.               (all shipped Linux packages)
                          (Bug introduced in version 2.5.7)
                        - Creating instances of the classes 'mv.impact.acquire.GenICam.SystemModule'            (mv.impact.acquire.dll)

                          possible pixel value was not affected by the LUT transformation.
                        - Fixed various minor issues not affecting user applications directly.                  (mvPropHandling-lib)

07.05.2013  2.5.7
                        CHANGED BEHAVIOUR:
                        - When the GEV filter driver detects packets belonging to a new frame that can't        (mvGigECapture.sys, version 2.0.11.45)
                          be reconstructed safely as too much data is missing already (e.g. because at the
                          time the transmission of the frame did start there was no buffer to capture the
                          data into and the capture buffer did arrive inside the driver after large parts of
                          the buffer have already been lost) the remains of these frames are dropped now.
                          Previous versions did report these frames as incomplete with the remains of the data.

                        UPDATES:
                        - Improved GEV acquisition streaming start speed.                                       (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                        - Added 'daoUseRawSensorGain' to the 'Camera/AdvancedOptions' property for              (mv.impact.acquire.dll)
                          mvBlueFOX-x05 devices.
                        - Some common functions, templates and classes used in various example applications     (all shipped packages)
                          moved into separate header files under $(MVIMPACT_ACQUIRE_DIR)/common.

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - Some code did rely on the SFNC feature 'PixelFormat' using the 'real' numerical       (mvGenTLConsumer-lib)
                          values as the integer representation of the enumeration entries, thus the entry for
                          'Mono8' for a GEV device was expected to have a numerical representation of
                          '0x01080001'. However the numerical values for SFNC enumerated features are not
                          covered by the standard thus in theory can be anything.
                        - Downloading the GenICam file from a device did align the amount of memory read to a   (mvGenTLConsumer-lib)
                          4-byte boundary. For transport layer technologies that are not restricted to a
                          certain alignment such as GenCP or U3V this could result in the device to complain
                          about too much memory being read.
                        - With 'Settings -> Property Grid -> Use Selector Grouping' active a read-only selector (wxPropGrid-lib)
                          automatically resulted in all selected features becoming read-only as well.
                        - Network adapters with an IPv4 address of 255.255.255.255 can discover GEV devices     (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          now.
                        - Alignment restrictions reported by the 'SIInfo' register of a U3V device are handled  (mvGenTLProducer.cti)

                          'normal' speed again.
                          (Bug introduced in version 2.4.0)
                        - 'GenICamInterfaceLayout' example does no longer crash under Linux.                    (all shipped Linux packages)
                        - The 'mvUserData' property of an mvBlueCOUGAR-X or mvBlueCOUGAR-XD device is no longer (mvGenTLConsumer-lib)
                          stored in a setting/restored from a setting. As this feature is stored in
                          non-volatile device memory restoring this value would modify the data in the device
                          which is not wanted.
                        - imageRequestSingle under Linux did always return an error.                            (mvHYPERIONfg-lib)
                        - Building low level drivers for Linux failed.                                          (low level mvHYPERION driver, Linux)

                          been flipped.
                        - For images in pixel format 'ibpfBGR101010Packed_V2' the 'ChannelSplit' filter did     (all shipped packages)
                          split in BGR order instead of RGB as for all other RGB and BGR formats.

                        CHANGED BEHAVIOUR:
                        - The U3V kernel driver will be installed by default now.                               (mvGenTL_Acquire*.msi)
                        - The properties 'Request::infoFrameID' and 'Request::infoFrameNr' are reported as 64   (all shipped packages)
                          bit integers now. Applications compiled with this version of the interface MUST
                          update mvPropHandling-lib on the target system when accessing these properties!

                        NEW FEATURES:
                        - Overloaded method for 'mv.impact.acquire.Property.readS' added that takes an input of (mv.impact.acquire.dll)

                        - For images with more than 8 bits per pixel per channel the left and right arrow keys  (wxPropView)
                          can be used to select which bits shall be displayed now.
                        - New function added: 'mvDispSetShift', 'mvDispGetShift', 'mvDisplayGetAppliedShift',   (mvDisplay-lib)
                        - New function added: 'mvIMPACT::acquire::display::ImageDisplay::GetShift',             (mvIMPACT_acquire_display.h)

                        - Color correction matrices added: 'cticmmBlueCOUGAR_Xx04C_WPPLS' and                   (all shipped packages)
                          'cticmmBlueCOUGAR_Xx04aC_WPPLS'. These will be used by mvBlueCOUGAR-X104C and
                          mvBlueCOUGAR-X104aC devices.

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - Capturing to user supplied memory with 'InterfaceLayout' set to 'dilDeviceSpecific'   (mvGenTLConsumer-lib)
                          did not work with mvBlueCOUGAR-X devices that came up with a GEV pixel format that
                          was using more than one channel.
                        - In rare cases (when the current working directory under Linux became invalid)         (all shipped Linux packages)
                          starting a mvIMPACT Acquire based application could crash.
                        - When Bayer images where generated by setting the properties 'Camera/PixelFormat' and  (mvVirtualDevice-lib)
                          'Camera/BayerMosaicParity' the driver internal de-Bayer filter did not process the

31.01.2013  2.3.4
                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - Fixed some compiler warnings.                                                         (mvHYPERIONfg-lib)

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - The buffers internally allocated used 1 byte too much memory. This could cause a      (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          decrease in the overall performance because of redundant reallocations.
                          (Bug introduced in version 2.0.9)
                        - Improved resend behaviour when working in LAG mode with 2 links or more. Sometimes    (mvGigECapture.sys, version 2.0.8.42)
                          parts of frames that already have been captured completely where requested for
                          resend.
                        - Timestamps for U3V devices will correctly be reported in us by the framework now.     (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                        - Temporary aborting a running acquisition by calling                                   (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          'FunctionInterface::imageRequestReset' could cause incorrect behaviour.
                          (Bug introduced in version 2.3.2)
                        - Improved FrameStart Activation LevelHigh/LevelLow. Previous versions did not          (mvHYPERIONfg-lib)
                          correctly work with this trigger event.

23.01.2013  2.3.2
                        CHANGED BEHAVIOUR:
                        - Migration to the official version 1.0 of the USB3 Vision standard. This required some (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          changes in internal data structures. Only devices compliant with version 1.0 of the
                          standard will be supported now.

                        NEW FEATURES:

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - When calling 'FunctionInterface::imageRequestSingle' after calling                    (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          'FunctionInterface::acquisitionStart' on a mvBlueLYNX-X device an error was logged,
                          but the request was not properly processed. This did result in the function
                          'FunctionInterface::imageRequestReset' not returning when called.
                        - Continuous acquisition from a USB3 Vision device did sometimes stop when e.g. post    (mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          processing of images took longer then the time between 2 consecutive images delivered
                          by the device.
                        - RealTimeController Opcode Jump, writing jump address corrected.                       (mvHYPERIONfg-lib)

                        - Added 'CPU Idle States Enabled' option (Windows only).                                (mvDeviceConfigure)
                        - Firmware version 1.5.61.0 for mvBlueCOUGAR-X devices added.                           (all shipped packages for GigE Vision devices)
                          New features:
                            - EV76C560/EV76C661: AEC and AGC implemented.
                            - Random delay added to discovery acknowledge as required by the GEV
                              specification, improves the detection of all cameras when there are many 
                              cameras connected to one subnet.
                          Changed behaviour:

                            - CCD sensors sometimes did deliver corrupt image data.
                              (Bug introduced in firmware version 1.5.18.0)

                        BUGS FIXED:

                          at runtime.

11.01.2013  2.3.0
                        CHANGED BEHAVIOUR:
                        - mvBlueCOUGAR-msi packages have been renamed to mvGenTL_Acquire-msi. Some libraries    (mvBlueCOUGAR.msi -> mvGenTL_Acquire.msi)
                          belonging to these packages also changed their name: mvBlueCOUGAR-lib became          (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib -> mvGenTLConsumer-lib)
                          mvGenTLConsumer-lib, mvTLIClientGigE.cti became mvGenTLProducer.cti. This change      (mvTLIClientGigE.cti -> mvGenTLProducer.cti)
                          became necessary as by now a much wider range of products(e.g. mvBlueFOX3, 
                          mvBlueLYNX-X) is supported by this package and therefore the names became misleading.
                          The old files are still part of the package but are not installed by default any more.
                          See 'Installation from private setup routines' for details.

                        UPDATES:

                          at the same time. This required a change in the way the GenICam runtime is installed  (mvGenTL_Acquire-x64.msi)
                          on the target system. See 'Installation from private setup routines' for details.
                        - Added some missing stuff to the documentation.                                        (all shipped packages)
                        - 'Done' button added to close the application.                                         (mvGigEConfigure)

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - 'CaptureToUserMemory' works with 'AcquisitionStartStopBehaviour' set to 'assbUser'    (all shipped packages)
                        - When sending multi-byte Bayer data to the internal de-Bayer algorithm with            (all shipped packages)
                          'ColorProcessing' set to 'cpmBayerToMono' did result in incorrect results on
                          multi-core systems.
                        - unmap user memory works now. Previous version did not unmap user memory if working in (mvHYPERION2.sys, version 2.1.36.44)
                          a 32-bit process on a 64-bit version of Windows.                                      (mvHYPERION.sys, version 1.0.51.53)
                        - Properties in mv.impact.acquire.Connector did always refer to the first device in     (mv.impact.acquire.dll)
                          the list of open devices supporting this feature even if the object was created with
                          a reference to a different device.
                        - Instances of mvIMPACT::acquire::CameraSettingsBase did always refer to the setting    (mvIMPACT_acquire.h)
                          'Base' as the parameter 'settingName' was not forwarded to the base class
                          constructor.

20.12.2012  2.2.2
                        UPDATES:
                        - Reading the current state of a digital input in 'DeviceSpecific' interface layout     (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib)

                          have been renamed. The functions will still be exported with the old names as well
                          thus this will not break existing binaries but will require changes in the source
                          during rebuilds. The following functions have been renamed:
                          - mvDestroyImageWindow: Use mvDispWindowDestroy instead.
                          - mvGetDisplayWindowHWnd: Use mvDispWindowGetWindowHandle instead.
                          - mvGetDisplayStructure: Use mvDispWindowGetDisplayHandle instead.
                          - mvInitDisplayWindow: Use mvDispWindowCreate instead.
                          - mvSetDisplayWindowRefreshTime: Use mvDispWindowSetRefreshTime instead.
                          - mvShowDisplayWindow: Use mvDispWindowShow instead.
                          - mvInstallPreProcHandler: Use mvDispWindowSetMessageHandler instead.
                          If re-building your application please note that when linking against the new export
                          names, the display library on the target system must be updated as well.

                        NEW FEATURES:
                        - 'mvIMPACT::acquire::ComponentIterator' is now just a typedef. All functions/features  (mvIMPACT_acquire.h)
                          of this class has been moved to the base class 'mvIMPACT::acquire::Component'. This
                          does not cause any compatibility issues, but will slightly improve the way feature
                          iteration can be used.
                        - Class mvIMPACT::acquire::GenICam::mvACCControl added.                                 (mvIMPACT_acquire_GenICam.h)
                        - All camera description recognised by a certain frame grabber will be created during   (mvHYPERIONfg-lib)
                          the initialisation now. Because of this change the class                              (mvSIGMAfg-lib)
                          mvIMPACT::acquire::CameraDescriptionManager can finally access all camera             (mvTITANfg-lib)
                          description that can be selected via the 'Camera/Type' property directly after
                          initialisation of a device.

                          operated in triggered mode.
                        - Calling 'mvDispUpdate' could crash in 'DM_FullScreen' mode if creating the            (mvDisplay-lib)
                          DirectDraw surface did fail before(e.g. because of missing user rights).
                        - Missing calling convention added to typedef of 'CBOBJChanged'.                        (mvDeviceManager-lib)
                        - X-Offset and Y-Offset for analysis controls where interchanged.                       (wxPropView)
                          (Bug introduced in version 1.12.28)
                        - Direct conversion of Bayer data to Mono8 improved. Border pixels are handled          (all shipped packages)
                          correctly now, RGB weighting uses the following formula now:
                          0.299 * R' + 0.587 * G' + 0.114 * B'.

24.05.2012  1.12.68
                        UPDATES:
                        - Color correction data for mvBlueCOUGAR specific sensors updated(EXPERIMENTAL!!!       (all shipped packages)
                          SUBJECT TO CHANGE!)

                        NEW FEATURES:
                        - Initial version with full .NET support that is independent from the mvIMPACT-SDK.     (mv.impact.acquire.dll)
                                                                                                                (mv.display.dll)
                        - New protected method 'mvIMPACT::acquire::Request::getComponentLocator' added. This    (mvIMPACT_acquire.h)
                          will make it a little easier to derive from 'mvIMPACT::acquire::Request'.
                        - Functions 'mvIMPACT::acquire::Request::unlock' and                                    (mvIMPACT_acquire.h)
                          'mvIMPACT::acquire::Request::configure' added. These functions result in the same
                          behaviour as calling 'mvIMPACT::acquire::FunctionInterface::imageRequestUnlock' and
                          'mvIMPACT::acquire::FunctionInterface::imageRequestConfigure' but allow to write
                          nicer code.
                        - Functions 'mvIMPACT::acquire::Request::attachUserBuffer' and                          (mvIMPACT_acquire.h)
                          'mvIMPACT::acquire::Request::detachUserBuffer' added. This will reduce the amount of
                          code needed to capture into user supplied memory.
                        - Function 'mvIMPACT::acquire::FunctionInterface::getCurrentCaptureBufferLayout' added. (mvIMPACT_acquire.h)
                          This will offer a new more convenient way find out what kind of buffers are needed to
                          capture into user supplied memory.
                        - Functions mvIMPACT::acquire::EnumPropertyF::getTranslationDictValues,                 (mvIMPACT_acquire.h)
                          mvIMPACT::acquire::EnumPropertyI::getTranslationDictValues and
                          mvIMPACT::acquire::EnumPropertyI64::getTranslationDictValues added.
                        - Function 'mvDispGetWindowHandle' added.                                               (mvDisplay-lib)
                        - Functions 'mvDispSetImageFromImageBuffer' and 'mvDispSetImageFromRequest' added       (mvDisplayExtensions.h)

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - mvDispGetError did return a random error code until the first error did occur or the  (mvDisplay-lib)
                          function was called a second time(uninitialized internal variable).
                        - mvBlueLYNX-X: Read of fallback EEPROM if default EEPROM contains an invalid MAC.      (mvTLIClientGigE-lib)

11.05.2012  1.12.67
                        DEPRECATED API CODE:
                        - mvIMPACT::acquire::Property::isConstDefined has been declared deprecated. Use         (mvIMPACT_acquire.h)

                            - New sensors: CMV2000, CMV4000, EV76C560 (color)
                            - New devices: mvBlueCOUGAR-XD.
                            - CCDs: Smear reduction property.
                            - FFC Feature extended: FFC works for sensor sizes > 1.8 Mega-Pixel, however the 
                              FFC data can not be stored in flash. Instead the data is accessible
                              using the File Control feature (up- and download).
                            - MT9P031: New pixel clock frequency: 98 MHz.
                            - EV76C560: LinescanMode (AcquisitionMode 'Continuous' only)
                            - MT9V034 can also use the FPGA's auto control features now.
                            - Support for events added ('EventExposureEnd' 'EventLine<n>RisingEdge').
                            - Application Switchover
                            - HeartbeatDisable
                          Changed behaviour:
                            - Many optimizations concerning the network behaviour (traversing firewalls, 
                              DHCP/AutoIP, Discovery Process, GigE Vision Protocol, etc...)
                            - 'ExposureActive' signal is now internally ANDed with the 'AcquisitionActive'
                              signal, useful for controlling lighting systems. It is now equivalent to the
                              DEPRECATED 'mvExposureAndAcquisitionActive' signal. The previous behaviour can be
                              obtained by using the new signal 'mvExposureActive'.
                            - GevSCBW unit changed (KByte/s -> KBps)
                            - Only one green LUT instead of LUT_GreenRed and LUT_GreenBlue is used now.
                            - Luminance LUT for RGB.
                          Bugs fixed:
                            - Color Transformation Matrix works with negative values, too
                            - MT9V034: AGC upper limit did not work correctly.
                            - using more than one OR gate caused unexpected results
                            - 'UserDefinedName' was lost after FW update
                            - FrameAverager (only -2xx)
                            - First line for all CCD sensors did contain incorrect data

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - 'can not access 'cameralink\serial\' in the network' during the installation.         (all shipped 64-bit MSI-based packages with CameraLink support)

                          mvIMPACT::acquire::WhiteBalanceSettings::WBResult. This might force you to change
                          your code during rebuilds but will not break existing binaries.

                          Acquire it will now use the global mvIMPACT Acquire version number.

                        UPDATES:

                          appropriate exception might be generated.
                        - Content descriptor of SDI camera descriptions changed from 'SDICamera' to 'SDI'.      (mvHYPERIONfg-lib)

                        NEW FEATURES:
                        - Capture into a user supplied buffer is working now.                                   (mvV4L-lib)

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - 'TLIMV_IFSetInterfaceParam' will be exported as all the other function under 32       (mvTLIClientGigE-lib)
                          Windows now. This will fix an error message being reported under 32-bit versions of
                          Windows when starting mvIPConfigure.

02.11.2010  1.11.32
                        NEW FEATURES:
                        - mvBlueFOX-MLC FPGA Version 0x1e: Supports I2C on IO connector                         (mvBlueFOX-lib)
                        - Firmware version 1.2.1.0 for mvBlueCOUGAR-X devices added.                            (all shipped packages for GigE Vision devices)
                          This firmware introduces massive changes in feature names and a lot of new features
                          like
                            - Chunkmode
                            - Extended Counter/Timer functionality
                            - New acquisition and trigger modes
                          However this firmware version is NOT fully backward compatible. If in doubt please
                          contact MATRIX VISION. Because of these changes it can also not be guaranteed that
                          older device driver will run in 'DeviceSpecific' interface layout when operated with
                          devices using a firmware version greater than 1.2.x thus updating the driver on these
                          systems is also highly recommended.
                        - Source code for mvIPConfigure added to MSI based installer                            (mvBlueCOUGAR.msi)
                                                                                                                (mvBlueCOUGAR-x64.msi)

28.10.2010  1.11.31
                        CHANGED BEHAVIOUR:
                        - After a PnP arrival event the digital outputs are restored to their previous state.   (mvBlueFOX-lib)

                        NEW FEATURES:
                        - Calculation of missed frames based on frame counter in Statistics/LostImagesCount.    (mvBlueFOX-lib)
                          Please note that e.g. when doing single snaps and the sensor runs in autotrigger mode
                          this will currently result in the lost image counter to increase so don't use
                          this parameter as a proof that frames have actually been missed. This depends on the
                          point of view and the application.
                        - Support for ibpfMono10 and ibpfMono16 added.                                          (mvV4L-lib)

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - Devices that do not support chunk mode can be opened again.                           (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib)
                          (Bug introduced in version 1.11.28)
                        - Certain Linux distribution could cause crashes during clean up work.                  (mvPropHandling-lib)

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - User AOI works with TabXGeometry 1X8 now.                                             (mvHYPERIONfg-lib)

                        - 12 bit acquisition mode added to mvHYPERION-HD-SDI.                                   (mvHYPERIONfg-lib)
                        - Firmware version 49 for mvBlueFOX devices added. This will add motor focus control    (mvBlueFOX-lib)
                          related features.

                        UPDATES:
                        - Enhanced chunk processing added. All chunk features will be part of the request info  (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib)
                          now and will reside in a sublist 'Info/ChunkData' of each request object.

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - The 64-bit Linux build of the GenICam GenTL producer did use an incorrect structure   (mvTLIClientGigE-lib)
                          alignment resulting in some registers returning an incorrect value when accessing
                          them via a GenApi nodemap.
                        - Fixed initializing of PulseStartConfiguration. Previous versions did program the      (mvHYPERIONfg-lib)
                          rotary decoder interface but not the default behaviour(trigger input signal).

08.10.2010  1.11.27
                        NEW FEATURES:
                        - Additional trigger delay added. Now it is possible to set also a trigger delay in     (mvHYPERIONfg-lib)
                          lines. The property delayAbs_usec is not affected from this new property. For working
                          with this new delay feature a mvHYPERION-CLm/CLf firmware upgrade to version 61 is 
                          required.

                        UPDATES:
                        - Improved detection of lost device access. If a device is no longer responding the     (mvTLIClientGigE-lib)
                          'State' property will be set to 'Absent'. When a device is responding again all       (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib)
                          communication channels will be re-created thus the device can be used again without
                          the need to close and re-open it.
                        - Request error handling improved, now error strings will be logged instead of error    (mvHYPERIONfg-lib)
                          codes.
                        - Further improved enhanced device discovery for misconfigured devices. A new detection (mvTLIClientGigE-lib)
                          mode has been added to mvIPConfigure. Switching it on and off enables and disables    (mvIPConfigure)
                          the usage of limited broadcasts for the device discovery. If a device is not visible
                          during 'normal' device discovery switching on limited broadcasts might help.

07.10.2010  1.11.26
                        UPDATES:
                        - Uncompressed versions of all the GenICam XML files processed will be written to       (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib)
                          a default directory automatically.

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - Potential memory corruption when changing from 'normal' operation to 'chunk' mode     (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib)
                          without changing the image resolution and then capturing data into a driver allocated
                          buffer that previously contained 'normal' image data.
                        - In interface layout 'dilGeneric' and 'dilGenICam' the 'ChunkModeActive' feature is    (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib)
                          no longer switched off automatically, when opening a device that supports the chunk
                          mode.

                        NEW FEATURES:
                        - 'AcquisitionStart' trigger added. Now it is possible to control acquisition start     (mvHYPERIONfg-lib)
                          independent from the 'FrameStart' trigger.
                        - Trigger counter read out added for 'FrameStart' and 'AcquisitionStart' trigger.       (mvHYPERIONfg-lib)
                                                                                                                (mvHYPERION2.sys, version 2.1.20.28)

                        CHANGED BEHAVIOUR:
                        - Previous trigger overlap mode(restart trigger mode) must be defined until now with    (mvHYPERIONfg-lib)
                          'FrameStart' and 'FrameStop' trigger. This change is not compatible with older
                          versions. Now both trigger lists must hold the same trigger signal definitions to
                          enable this restart mode.

                        UPDATES:
                        - Improved device discovery introduced in version 1.11.23 does no longer take more      (mvTLIClientGigE-lib)
                          time. It's even faster than all previous versions now.                                (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib)

                        CHANGED BEHAVIOUR:
                        - Discovery of misconfigured GEV devices improved. Now devices e.g. using a persistent  (mvTLIClientGigE-lib)
                          IP address connected to an adapter that resides in a different net can be discovered  (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib)
                          as well. However this increases the device enumeration time per adapter.
                        - Increased 'PoolSize' registry parameter from 64 MB to 256 MB for Cognex adapter.      (all shipped MSI-based packages)
                          This will fix certain timeout issues when running devices with high resolutions via

                          'Camera->PixelFormat=Mono8'.
                        - The property 'HardwareInit' and the feature list 'OnBoardMemory' have been moved      (mvTITANfg-lib)
                          from 'DeviceSpecificData' to the device list that is available also before opening
                          a device. The old location of the feature will continue to work, but should not be
                          used any more. If the newer version of the features have been modified, these will be
                          used, if not the old version will be used.
                        - New sample added: 'ContinuousCaptureDirectX'.                                         (all shipped MSI based packages)

                          - First image after changing the exposure time or the gain was taken with the old
                            sensor timing
                          - When connected to certain 3COM PoE Hubs/Switches the cameras didn't work correctly
                          - AOI/Frame rate related behaviour has been improved.
                          - Some minor GEV protocol specific issues.

                                been renamed to 'USBRetransmitCount'. See the corresponding 
                                'Porting existing code' section for details.

                        CHANGED BEHAVIOUR: The class mvIMPACT::acquire::Info has been renamed
                                to mvIMPACT::acquire::InfoBlueFOX. See the corresponding 'Porting
                                existing code' section for details.

                        NEW FEATURE: Support for frame grabbers added (mvTITAN (RGB-G4, RGB-G3, CL, G1, DIG))   (mvTITANfg-lib)
                                mvGAMMA (G, CL), mvSIGMA(SLC, SQ), mvDELTA).                                    (mvSIGMAfg-lib)

                        NEW FEATURE/CHANGED BEHAVIOUR: mvPropView only checks for overlay (DD)                  (mvPropView)
                                when it needs it and displays a message on failure. DirectDraw
                                overlay is only needed/used for YUV422Packed images currently.
                                export/save operations can now be cancelled.

                        NEW FEATURE: Logging is now fully supported. See corresponding section
                                in the manual.

                        NEW FEATURE: A wxWidgets based version of mvPropView has been added to
                                the setup. It has some nice features(live histogram, line
                                profile) and a Linux version is available as well. However its
                                display performance is weaker than the MFC based mvPropView, which
                                is the reason, why no short cut will be created on the desktop.
                                However the higher CPU load is ONLY caused by the applications
                                way of displaying the images and has nothing to do with the
                                performance of the interface itself. It can be found in the
                                'bin' folder of the installation.

16.02.2006      1.4.5
                        UPDATE: Internally the C++ interface now uses the class 'ExceptionFactory'
                                to create exceptions.

                        BUGFIX: long time integration sometimes produced incorrect images.                      (mvBlueFOX-lib)

                                declaration of file I/O. Previous versions interpreted the sfNative
                                flag NOT set as file output. This method is now deprecated but still
                                supported. New applications should us the sfFile flag. This also 
                                allows to do file output AND native output with a single function
                                call (by combining(sfNative | sfFile)).

                        NEW BEHAVIOUR: std::map and std::set dependencies removed from C++ wrapper
                                FunctionInterface::getAvaiableSettings now returns a string
                                vector instead of a string set(reason: .NET support).

31.05.2005      1.3.0
                        NEW BEHAVIOUR: The underlying C-API has been moved completely to the                    (mvDeviceManager-lib)
                                mvDeviceManager-lib. Applications compiled with and older version
                                of this interface MUST be recompiled, re-linked and maybe modified.
                                See the corresponding 'Porting existing code' section for details.
                                This allows to use the supported devices from other programming
                                languages (such as Visual Basic or Delphi) as well.

                        BUGFIX: mvi_acquire.h has been adapted to work with the compiler bugs
                                of the Visual Studio 6.x compiler.

                        NEW FEATURE: The setup has been reorganized. There are now workspaces
                                for Visual Studio 6.x, 7.x and Borland C++ Builder 6.x for all
                                Sample programs.

                        NEW SAMPLE: ContinuousCapture_C shows how to work with the 'C' compliant
                                interface.

                        NEW BEHAVIOUR: It's no longer necessary to link mvPropHandling.lib.                     (mvDeviceManager-lib)
                                Only mvDeviceManager.lib is needed now.

                        UPDATE: Bayer conversion speed optimised for mvBlueFOX devices.                         (mvBlueFOX-lib)

                        BUGFIX: mvBlueFOX 121 with 40MHz pixel clock is now working properly.                   (mvBlueFOX-lib)

                        1.2.2 NEW FEATURE: Hibernating support added for mvBlueFOX devices.                     (mvBlueFOX-lib)

                        NEW BEHAVIOUR: Searching devices is now down in the mvDeviceManager-lib.                (mvDeviceManager-lib)
                                This will require an up to date mvDeviceManager-lib on each
                                target system compiled with the actual version of the mvi_acquire.h!

                        NEW BEHAVIOUR: Device::setID and Device::updateFirmware now call direct                 (mvDeviceManager-lib version 1.2.2.6)
                                exports of the mvDeviceManager-lib.
                                This will require an up to date mvDeviceManager-lib on each
                                target system compiled with the actual version of the mvi_acquire.h!

                        NEW BEHAVIOUR: matchString function removed!

                        NEW PROPERTY: Info::SensorType.

                        BUGFIX: Visibility flag for components in invisible sublists is                         (mvPropHandling-lib)
                                correct now.

                        BUGFIX: import of XML ComponentLists.                                                   (mvPropHandling-lib)

                        NEW FEATURE: AGC and AEC are available under mvPropView now.                            (mvBlueFOX-lib)

                        NEW FEATURE: MirrorMode property (allows horizontal or vertical flipping                (mvBlueFOX-lib)
                                of the image. See ImageProcessing::MirrorMode.

                        NEW FEATURE: USB 1.1 support added for mvBlueFOX cameras.                               (mvBlueFOX-lib)

20.04.2005      1.2.0
                        NEW FUNCTION Property::readSArray.                                                      (mvPropHandling-lib)

                        NEW BEHAVIOUR: FunctionInterface::createSetting and 
                                FunctionInterface::createImageRequestControl don't throw exceptions
                                anymore, but return an error code if the call failed. 

                        BUGFIX: An error is reported, if XML-settings can't be located.                         (mvPropHandling-lib)

                        NEW FEATURE: TComponentFlag::cfShouldBeDisplayedAsList.                                 (mvPropHandling-lib)

                        UPDATE: C++ wrapper header structure reorganized. Now there is only one header
                                ( mvi_acquire.h ).

                        NEW BEHAVIOUR: Certain things in the interface have been changed. Some
                                will force you to recompile your application, some will
                                even force you to modify existing code. We are still in the 
                                beta stadium, but we are getting closer to a stable interface.
                                Some exported function modified or removed from mvPropHandling.h

                        BUGFIX: Destroying a DeviceManager object doesn't leave invalid windows                 (mvDeviceManager-lib)

                        NEW BEHAVIOUR: Missing units added to some properties.

                        BUGFIX: Various minor fixes.

11.03.2005      1.1.1
                        NEW BEHAVIOUR: In mvPropHandlingDataTypes.h the unsigned int constants                  (mvPropHandling-lib)
                                for defining the operation mode of search functions have been
                                renamed to avoid confusion with the TStorageFlag type. The leading
                                'sf' has been renamed to 'sm'. The constant 'sfSearchSublists' has
                                been removed, as the underlying behaviour can be expressed by the
                                maximum search depth as well. This is an incompatible change which 
                                might force you to modify existing source.

                        NEW FEATURE: New TStorageFlag added: sfProcessInheritance.                              (mvPropHandling-lib)

                        BUGFIX: Deadlock removed when multiple threads accessed the property                    (mvPropHandling-lib)
                                module.

                        DOCUMENTATION UPDATED

                        NEW FEATURE: New sample program added (ContinuousCaptureAllDevices), to
                                demonstrate how to access all supported devices found in the
                                current system in a single application.

                        BUGFIX: PropertyS::read function caused an access violation when building
                                the result string when a NULL-pointer was returned by the function.

                        BUGFIX: Noisy images for certain sensor types of the mvBlueFOX.                         (mvBlueFOX-lib)

                        BUGFIX: Wrong colours in Bayer converted images for 1024*768 sensor.                    (mvBlueFOX-lib)
