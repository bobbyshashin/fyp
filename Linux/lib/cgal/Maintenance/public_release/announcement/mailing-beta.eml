Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Body: 

The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce the release 4.9 Beta 1
of CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.

CGAL version 4.9 Beta 1 is a public testing release. It should provide
a solid ground to report bugs that need to be tackled before the
release of the final version of CGAL 4.9 in September.


Besides fixes and general enhancement to existing packages, the following
has changed since CGAL 4.8:

  o General

    - CGAL can now be used in headers only mode, i.e. without compiling the
      CGAL libraries and linking with these libraries when compiling
      examples, tests and demos. Note that running CMake on CGAL is still
      required in order to generate some configuration files.


  o Cone Based Spanners (new package)

    - This package provides algorithms for constructing two kinds of
      cone-based spanners: Yao graph and Theta graph, given a set of
      vertices on the plane and the directions of cone boundaries.


See http://www.cgal.org/releases.html for a complete list of changes.


The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data
structures and algorithms, like
- triangulations (2D constrained triangulations, Delaunay triangulations
  and periodic triangulations in 2D and 3D),
- Voronoi diagrams (for 2D and 3D points, 2D additively weighted
  Voronoi diagrams, and segment Voronoi diagrams),
- Boolean operations on polygons and polyhedra,
- regularized Boolean operations on polygons with curved arcs
- arrangements of curves,
- mesh generation (2D, 3D and surface mesh generation,
  surface mesh subdivision and parametrization),
- alpha shapes (in 2D and 3D),
- convex hull algorithms (in 2D, 3D and dD),
- operations on polygons (straight skeleton and offset polygon),
- search structures (kd trees for nearest neighbor search, and
  range and segment trees),
- interpolation (natural neighbor interpolation and placement of
  streamlines),
- optimization algorithms (smallest enclosing sphere of points or
  spheres, smallest enclosing ellipsoid of points, principal
  component analysis),
- kinetic data structures
